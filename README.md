# Stanford_CS224n (Natural Language Understanding)

This repository contains my solution to the Stanford course "[Natural Language Understanding](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224u/)" under CS224u code by prof. [Bill MacCartney](http://nlp.stanford.edu/~wcmac/) and Prof.[Christopher Potts](http://web.stanford.edu/~cgpotts/) in 2019-2020.

This repository contains my solution, but if you want the original assignment, they can be found via the official repository right [here](https://github.com/cgpotts/cs224u/). Also, you can watch the lectures for free on YouTube. Here is the official [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rObpMCir6rNNUlFAn56Js20).
