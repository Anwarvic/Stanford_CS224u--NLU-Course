# Stanford_CS224n (Natural Language Understanding)

This repository contains my solution to the Stanford course "[Natural Language Understanding](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224u/)" under CS224u code by prof. [Bill MacCartney](http://nlp.stanford.edu/~wcmac/) and Prof.[Christopher Potts](http://web.stanford.edu/~cgpotts/) in 2019-2020.

This repository contains my solution, but if you want the original assignment, they can be found via the official repository right [here](https://github.com/cgpotts/cs224u/). Also, you can watch the lectures for free on YouTube. Here is the official [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rObpMCir6rNNUlFAn56Js20).


## About the Course

Project-oriented class focused on developing systems and algorithms for robust machine understanding of human language. Draws on theoretical concepts from linguistics, natural language processing, and machine learning. There will be special lectures on developing projects, presenting research results, and making connections with industry.

It's expected to learn these few concepts after taking this course:

- Lexical semantics
- Distributed representations of meaning
- Relation extraction
- Semantic parsing
- Sentiment analysis
- Dialogue agents



## Acknowledgement
